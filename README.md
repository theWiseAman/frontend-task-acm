The tasks have been implemented, and above website code repository is being hosted on domain:-
https://thewiseaman.github.io/frontend-task-acm/

### Please implement page in assests folder with the name design.png in software stack of your choice with the following requirements:

- Assume that you have data already returned from JSON service. Structure of that JSON is up to you.
- Functionality of adding comments should be implemented - comment box doesn't have to look fancy, but user should be able to add a comment which then will be displayed on page. Note: This comment doesn't have to be stored on server - it can vanish after full page reload.
- Thumbs-up/thumbs-down and stars are two separate things, one doesn't influence another in any way. This is also static content; it's not meant to rate the hotel, it's just displaying data.
- Text should expand after clicking at any part of it. Collapsing text doesn't have to be implemented.
- Font used is Open Sans - you will find it on Google Fonts.
- Thumbs up / thumbs down / stars are all part of Font Awesome.
- You don't have to use exact user pictures, you can grab random ones from e.g. https://randomuser.me/
- Header background image - pick whatever you want from Flickr or similar.
- It doesn't have to render on a server.
- HTML/Component (if used) structure is totally up to you.
- All required assets are located in assets folder ( logo ).
- Page doesn't have to be responsive. Layout doesn't have to be pixel perfect.
- It's only client side "application" (we used quotes, because it's only one page - hard to call it "application" ;)

Have fun!
